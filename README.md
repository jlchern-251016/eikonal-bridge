## 🎯  Overview

This repository contains the companion materials for *The Eikonal Bridge*, a comprehensive technical book that unifies classical optical design with quantum photonics through the power of differentiable computing.

**The Central Innovation**: The Differentiable Eikonal Engine (DEE) framework uses JAX automatic differentiation to bridge two traditionally separate worlds—classical lens design and quantum photonics—through a single elegant identity:

```
φ_quantum = 2π × W_eikonal / λ
```

This **bridge identity** reveals that the classical eikonal function (optical path length) and quantum optical phase are the same mathematical object, enabling unified computational tools for both domains.

## Who This Book Is For

- **Optical Engineers** transitioning from CODE V/Zemax to quantum photonics applications
- **Quantum Physicists** seeking practical lens design foundations for photonic systems
- **Graduate Students** in optics, photonics, and quantum information science
- **Researchers** exploring differentiable programming for optical design

## The W/MN Duality Framework

Every chapter presents optical problems from dual perspectives:

| Perspective | Question | Approach |
|-------------|----------|----------|
| **Walther (Forward)** | "Given this device, what does it do?" | Analysis, simulation, characterization |
| **Matsui-Nariai (Inverse)** | "Given this target, how do I build it?" | Design, optimization, synthesis |

This duality provides a universal problem-solving methodology that applies across classical and quantum domains.

## Three-Axis Failure Framework

When does the scalar eikonal approximation break down? Our systematic diagnostic framework identifies failure modes across three axes:

| Axis | Codes | Failure Modes |
|------|-------|---------------|
| **Physical** | P1-P5 | High NA, polarization, dispersion, nonlinearity, thermal |
| **Mathematical** | M1-M5 | Singularities, discontinuities, non-differentiable, ill-conditioned, numerical precision |
| **Topological** | T1-T3 | OAM, Berry phase, topological charge |
