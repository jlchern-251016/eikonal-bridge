# The Eikonal Bridge
**From classical lens design to quantum photonics through differentiable computing**

A 12-chapter bridge that reframes optics through the eikonal (optical path length) and Hamilton–Jacobi viewpoint. 

It unifies ray, wave, and quantum descriptions, introducing Walther (forward analysis) versus Matsui–Nariai (inverse design) duality. 

Chapters cover Hamilton characteristic functions, wavefront aberrations, beyond-scalar multi-level eikonal ideas, and eigenmode-eikonal for waveguides, plus quantum-inspired optimization. 

The practical centerpiece is a JAX-based Differentiable Eikonal Engine enabling fast gradients, verification, and tolerance/yield workflows. 

Later chapters connect to quantum wavefront sensing, quantum walks, N-photon phase multiplication, and a lab-to-fab path.
